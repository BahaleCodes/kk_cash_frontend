                    <div className="body-text"><p><span>KK Cash is different from other online lenders because our sophisticated risk and decision technology means the application and approval process takes literally minutes. We are the first company in the world to fully automate the lending process and we are able to make completely objective and responsible decisions around the clock. There's no paperwork, no need to meet with a bank manager and no sitting for hours on hold on the phone â€“ our entire service is online and real-time. We are also uniquely flexible, allowing applicants to choose exactly how much cash they want to borrow and for how many days they need it. Our customers aren't forced to borrow a fixed sum they might not need, or pay interest for any longer than necessary.</span></p></div>
                    <h3 className="sub-heading">We&#39;re responsible</h3>
                    <div className="body-text"><p><span>KK Cash offers short term loans for up to 3 months for new customers, and up to 6 months for existing customers. We make money when our customers repay us quickly, not by continually extending a growing line of credit. We are serious about our commitment to responsible lending.</span></p></div>
                    <h3 className="sub-heading">KK Cash moments</h3>
                    <div className="body-text"><p><span>In an ideal world no-one would need to borrow money but, in reality, everybody has the occasional KK Cash moment - those times in life where an urgent expense or purchase pops up from nowhere and at a really bad time. You need some cash to tide you over for a few days or weeks and you need it fast. We believe it's best to sort out short term cash flow problems with a short term solution. So whether it's the car that's just conked out, an urgent bill has just arrived or you've just remembered your wedding anniversary with hours to spare... Don't worry, KK Cash it!</span></p></div>
