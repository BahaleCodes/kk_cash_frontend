                <em>The money is transferred to your bank account.</em>
                <p>We will be hard at work behind the scenes to verify your income and transfer the cash to your bank account.We will collect repayment from your bank account on the due date, so you just need to ensure the required funds are available.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h3 className="sub-heading">Short term credit</h3>
                <p>We don’t want to keep you in debt. That may sound odd coming from any lender, but KK Cash provides fast cash advances for a few days or weeks. If you're a new customer, we’ll only lend you money for up to 3 months, and if you're an existing customer, you can repay over up to 6 months. You are always free to pay us back early with no hidden fees.</p>
                <p>Unlike some lenders or credit card providers, we won’t keep extending your existing balance or encourage you to make minimum repayments. So please think very carefully before you apply, because we expect you to repay us when you promise to. If you have any doubts or are unsure you'll be able to do that comfortably, please don’t apply in the first place.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h3 className="sub-heading">Transparency</h3>
                <p>We'll always tell you upfront what the total cost of your loan will be. There are no catches or extra fees to worry about, providing you stick to your side of the agreement by paying the loan back on time. Our loan offering has a maximum monthly interest rate of just 5%. We also show you the cost of your loan upfront, with a clear breakdown of interest and fees. Included in this is our R69 per month service fee (pro-rated for the first 30 days) and our initiation fee that helps cover the administrative costs for setting up your loan with KK Cash. All of this is shown on our slider so you can view the cost breakdown of a loan before you apply. All fees include 15% VAT.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h3 className="sub-heading">Failure to stick to your side of the deal</h3>
                <p>The only way costs will mount beyond our initial calculation is if you aren’t able to make the repayment on the agreed repayment date. If our collection attempt is declined by your bank we will do our best to contact you immediately . We always try to resolve the situation that day and your bank may charge you for not having sufficient funds available in your account.</p>
                <p>We will then make further attempts to collect the money from your account and our collections team will keep trying to contact you to discuss the situation. If your circumstances have changed significantly, they will do their best to offer a solution and come to an arrangement that helps you get back on your feet.</p>
                <p>We don’t believe in applying on-going charges, but interest and service fees will continue to mount on your balance for a period. If you don't work with us and we can't recover the money over a reasonable period, your account may be passed to an external legal collections partner, which means additional costs could be added to the amount you already owe.</p>
                <p>Continued failure to repay a loan will also mean credit bureaus will record the outstanding debt. Records remain on file for a number of years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.</p>
                <p>Finally, your <a href="/trust-rating">trust rating</a> and your next KK Cash application may be impacted, and you probably won't be able to borrow from us again.</p>
                <p>None of these things are worth the risk, so if you have doubts about whether you'll be able to repay a loan, please don't put yourself under more financial pressure by applying.</p>
